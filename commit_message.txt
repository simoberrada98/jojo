fix(payment): handle undefined credentials in hoodpaystrategy

Previously, the `HoodPayStrategy` class did not correctly handle the case where the `apiKey` or `businessId` were `undefined`. This resulted in a TypeScript error when the environment variables were not set.

This commit resolves the issue by:

1.  Changing the type of `apiKey` and `businessId` to `string | undefined`.
2.  Using the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to assign the values in the constructor.
3.  Adding a check in the `process` method to ensure that the `apiKey` and `businessId` are available before making a payment.

These changes make the code more robust and prevent TypeScript errors when the HoodPay credentials are not configured.
