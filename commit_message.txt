fix(db): add if not exists to create table statements

The previous migration failed because the `orders` and `order_items` tables already existed in the database. This commit resolves the issue by adding the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause to the `CREATE TABLE` statements in the migration file.

This will ensure that the migration can be run multiple times without causing errors.
