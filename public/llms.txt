| Miner inventory is unavailable right now. Please refresh after syncing Supabase credentials. |

Comparison matrix of ASIC miners with key specifications

## How to use this matrix

- Review efficiency against your facility power cost to prioritise miners that reduce heat density per rack.
- Use the noise column to set acoustic expectations for retail or hosted deployments; anything above 75 dB requires hearing protection.
- Follow each linked product page for warranty coverage, payment methods, and availability windows.

## ASIC Miner Buying Guide
[Skip to main content](https://www.jhuangnyc.com/guides/asic-buying-guide#main-content)

## Phase 1: Evaluate Miner Fundamentals

Start with technical viability: select miners with stable firmware support, proven chip yields, and component availability. Validate efficiency targets against your utility profile and avoid models outside Tier 1 manufacturer roadmaps.

| Factor | Target guardrail | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hashrate-to-Watt ratio | >= 30 GH/W (SHA-256) or >= 8 GH/W (Scrypt) | Higher ratios reduce cooling and energy costs while keeping hashrate stable. |
| All-in power cost | <= $0.07/kWh after power credits or hosting agreements | Use blended rate including demand, rack, and redundancy premiums. |
| Break-even horizon | 12-18 months with 15% sensitivity applied to hashrate and price | Model downside case with difficulty + hashprice compression. |
| Resale floor | >= 35% of landed price after 24 months | Track historical secondary markets for backup liquidity. |

ROI guardrails for ASIC hardware selection

## Phase 2: Model Pricing & Cash Flow

Price miners against a blended cash-flow model: include duties, freight forwarding, rack fees, uptime SLAs, and the cost of capital. Layer in conservative hashprice assumptions and contract-specific energy escalators.

- Run three-scenario modelling (base, stress, upside) with real-time difficulty curves and compare to infrastructure amortization.
- Allocate 5-8% of CapEx to spares, hot-swappable PSUs, and control board inventory for rapid RMA turnaround.
- Track opportunity cost against co-located hosting offers; demand uptime credits and transparent power pass-through.

## Phase 3: Deployment Readiness Checklist

Confirm that facilities, security, and support teams have actionable runbooks before container arrival. Use the following RACI-style table to formally accept each stage.

| Milestone | Accountable owners | Evidence required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Facility power and cooling verification | Facilities + Electrical engineer | Load test report, breaker schedule, airflow modelling |
| Network segmentation & monitoring | Security + DevOps | Dedicated VLAN, firewall rules, uptime monitor dashboards |
| Warranty & RMA process | Procurement + Support | Serial tracking in CMDB, RMA SLA acknowledgement from manufacturer |
| Spare parts & onsite spares | Operations | Fan, PSU, controller inventory with lead times |
