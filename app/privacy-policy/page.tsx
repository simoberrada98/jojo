                  Checkout flows are handled end-to-end with Stripe, which
                  tokenizes sensitive cardholder data and shares only the last
                  four digits and expiration date with our team. This keeps the
                  app responsive while preventing us from ever storing full card

                    We authorize the payment to confirm funds, generate your
